            As previously mentioned, I had painted the stool when I was younger
            and this is what it looked like before. it was originally just a
            wooden stool. This design that I did with a handmade cutout stencil
            of Mickey Mouse and some random circles had been standing in my room
            for quite some years and I felt it was time for a change.

          <div class="describe2">
            I started off by painting the whole stool white, a few coats were
            required since the purple paint I previously used was quite strong.
            I also wanted to make sure none of the circles or Mickey Mouse was
            visible underneath the new one. This was also the time for me to
            decide on the new design I wanted to do.

            After doing some brainstorming and googling, I found an inspiration
            picture online and started sketching my city. Buildings is not
            something I have drawn a lot of before so I was nervous before
            starting the sketch. Proportions is an important thing in a drawing
            like this.

          />
          <div class="describe4">
            The inspiration picture I looked at was in black and white but I
            knew that I wanted to include colors, neutral colors. With acrylic
            paints, I started mixing a lot of colors to get different nuances
            for the buildings. I for example only had two different tones of
            brown and in order to not make the image look flat, I mixed them
            with red, green, blue or yellow for variation.

            width="40%"
            height="40%"
          />
          <div class="describe5">
            Since the buildings and the city are concentrated at the bottom of
            the flat surface I felt that the top looked a bit empty. After some
            contemplation I decided to add some hot air balloons and clouds. I
            am very content with the outcome and I had a lot of fun doing it.
            However in a couple of years I will probably redo it again ðŸ˜†
