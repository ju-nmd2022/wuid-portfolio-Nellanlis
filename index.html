      Usually one would start their personal introduction off by saying "Hello,
      my name is Nelly and I am 20 years old". That is exactly what I am going
      to do as well.

    <em>Hi! My name is Nelly and I am indeed 20 years old!</em>

      Nowadays I am situated in <a href="extension.html">Jönköping</a> to study
      New Media Design at Jönköping University. I grew up in a small town about
      one and a half hour from here with my family of 6 members. I am the oldest
      out of four sibilings, I have two younger sisters and one younger brother
      who just turned 7 years old. He constantly wanted to play Minecraft with
      me when I still lived with my parents.

      In my freetime I play floorball, which is a very popular sport in Sweden.
      It is similar to ice hockey but it is not played on ice and there is a
      plastic ball instead of a puck. I have been participating in the sport
      since I was 6 years old and when I moved to Jönköping, I had to switch
      teams and was able to meet new teammates and friends. Most of the people I
      hang out with are friends that I met through playing floorball. Me and my
      friends have spread out to live in many different parts of Sweden, but we
      try to see each other as often as possible.

      One hobby I have held onto my whole life was drawing. I love being
      creative and doing arts and crafts. For a couple years, nail art was the
      outlet I chose for my creativity. I painted small, intricate designs on my
      finger nails, funnily enough only on my left hand since I am right handed.
      I was constantly walking around with one hand painted with nail polish.
      For a while, I also nisched myself into a corner of painting furniture,
      not just in one color, but also having smaller details on the piece of
      furniture. Almost like it was its own painting. Learn more about my work<a

      Because I like being creative, I knew I wanted to do something in life
      that was creative. I chose to study New Media Design at JU because it is a
      practical education that lets you be creative. The fact that it also
      includes programming and doing graphics on the computer will be very
      valuable when looking for workplaces further along the road.
