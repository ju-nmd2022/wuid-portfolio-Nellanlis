      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Jönköping is also pretty large in area and there are a lot of things to
        do in the different parts. There are a lot of nice trails in nature for
        those who wants to go out hiking, especially in the outer parts of
        Jönköping municipality. And there is also the city life where you have
        loads of shopping along the cobbled roads. If you want to combine the
        two you can visit one of the city parks, like rådhusparken or
        knektaparken. In the summer, the beach right next to Vättern is the
        place to be. <em>Vätterstranden</em> is the most popular and it will be
        crowded on the sunny days.
