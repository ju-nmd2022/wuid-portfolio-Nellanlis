          <div class="describe">Nail art was something I was very passionate about a couple of years ago. This is one example of the nail art I did where I drew some Mickey Mouse characters, it was all done with regular nailpolish and tiny brushes. I posted a lot of my designs on Instagram and I have linked the profile at the bottom of this page. </div>

          <div class="describe2">This is one of the pieces of furniture that I have painted. It is an old classic IKEA stool that I once painted when I was a child, and then decided to repaint a few years ago. I took inspiration from an image online of a city skyline and did my own version of it. Click the picture to see the process! :)</div>

          <div class="describe3">This is a crochet turtle I did following a template. I loved crochet when I was in secondary school and one of my friends had yarn in all imaginable colors at her house. We would sit for many hours doing crochet and I learnt a lot about it. I still do it sometimes when I find inspiration for it.   </div>

          <div class="describe4">One hobby I have that I do most days is taking pictures. Even though I do not have a fancy camera, I love capturing moments with my phone. I will walk around and suddenly feel the urge to take a picture, because it's the perfect moment, and then I have to bring up my camera.</div>

          <div class="describe5">We recently started working in photoshop at school and this is one of the very first projects I did in there. The task was to combine two fruits into one and I merged together a pineapple with a grapefruit. I will be editing a lot of my future photographs in photoshop to make them even better. </div>
